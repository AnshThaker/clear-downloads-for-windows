This is the repository of Clear Downloads for Windows. Clear Downloads is a straightforward yet powerful tool that swiftly clears your downloads folder in Windows. There are also several modes to choose from, each of which can be used to only remove particular types of files. 

!IMPORTANT! - 
Google Drive and Microsoft Defender (or any other Anti-Virus) may flag the installer as a virus, but don't worry, this is just a false alarm. Since the installer is an executable (.exe or .msi), it is assumed that it is risky to run the installer. When Microsoft Defender blocks the installer, click on 'More Info' and click 'Run Anyway'. Your PC would not be harmed in any way. If you don't trust the installer, please feel free to examine our source code.

Since Clear Downloads is completely free and open-source, you can navigate to the 'src' folder to view the source code and project files.
